\# ðŸ§© T2.1.2 â€” Definition of the Cost Function and Auxiliary Metrics



\## 1. Purpose

To formally define the mathematical expressions for the \*\*cost function\*\* and \*\*auxiliary evaluation metrics\*\* that drive the optimization process.

The objective is to minimize the total anesthesiologist cost while ensuring efficient utilization of working time.

\## 2. Core Objective: Cost Minimization



\### 2.1. Total Cost Function

The main optimization objective is to minimize the total cost of anesthesiologist shifts:



C\_total = Î£(cost\[a]) for all a âˆˆ A



Each shift cost `cost\[a]` is calculated as a piecewise function combining base pay, minimum guaranteed time, and overtime compensation:



cost\[a] = max(SHIFT\_MIN, duration\[a]) + (OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER âˆ’ 1) Ã— max(0, duration\[a] âˆ’ SHIFT\_OVERTIME)



where:



| Parameter | Meaning |

|------------|----------|

| SHIFT\_MIN | Minimum paid shift duration (5h) |

| SHIFT\_OVERTIME | Overtime threshold (9h) |

| OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER | Pay rate multiplier for overtime (1.5Ã—) |

| SHIFT\_MAX | Maximum legal shift duration (12h) |

| duration\[a] | Actual shift length = t\_max\[a] âˆ’ t\_min\[a] |



The \*\*cost\*\* increases linearly with duration up to 9 hours and grows with slope Ã—1.5 beyond that point.

If the shift duration is below 5 hours, the anesthesiologist is still paid for the minimum of 5 hours.



---



\### 2.2. Feasibility Condition

Each anesthesiologistâ€™s shift must satisfy:



SHIFT\_MIN â‰¤ duration\[a] â‰¤ SHIFT\_MAX



If `ENFORCE\_SURGERY\_DURATION\_LIMIT = true`, then any surgery exceeding 12 hours automatically invalidates the schedule.

Otherwise, it generates a warning in validation logs.



---



\## 3. Auxiliary Metrics



\### 3.1. Utilization (U)

Utilization measures how efficiently the total paid anesthesiologist time is used for active surgeries:



U = Î£(duration\_surgeries) / Î£(cost\_anesthesiologists)



\- Numerator: total surgical time across all surgeries.

\- Denominator: total compensated shift duration (including idle and overtime time).

\- Target: U â‰¥ UTILIZATION\_TARGET (by assignment definition, 0.8 or 80%).



A higher utilization value indicates better time efficiency and scheduling compactness.



---



\### 3.2. Number of Active Anesthesiologists

To indirectly penalize excessive staff usage, we define:



N\_active = Î£(active\[a]) for all a âˆˆ A

where `active\[a] = 1` if anesthesiologist `a` participates in at least one surgery.



This metric can be included as a secondary optimization term to balance cost and resource minimization.



---



\### 3.3. Idle Time (per shift)

Idle time quantifies the non-productive interval between surgeries within a shift:



Idle\[a] = duration\[a] âˆ’ Î£(duration\_surgeries assigned to a)



Aggregate idle time across all anesthesiologists gives an additional diagnostic metric:



Idle\_total = Î£(Idle\[a])



This value is not directly optimized but used for model evaluation and heuristic fine-tuning.



---



\## 4. Extended Objective (Optional)

In multi-objective form, the solver can balance between minimizing total cost and reducing the number of active anesthesiologists:



Minimize:

Total\_Objective = Î± Ã— Î£(active\[a]) + Î² Ã— Î£(cost\[a])



with weight parameters (Î± >> Î²) to prioritize minimizing the number of anesthesiologists before cost.
