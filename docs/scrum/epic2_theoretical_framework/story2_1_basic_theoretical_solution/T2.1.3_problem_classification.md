\# üß© T2.1.3 ‚Äî Classification of the Problem by Computational Complexity



\## 1. Purpose

To analyze the computational nature of the anesthesiologist allocation optimization problem, determine its position in known complexity classes, and evaluate theoretical solvability and scalability limits.



---



\## 2. Problem Type

The problem belongs to the general class of \*\*combinatorial optimization\*\* ‚Äî the search for an optimal combination of discrete assignments under constraints.



Formally, it combines features of:

\- \*\*Assignment Problem\*\* ‚Äî assigning anesthesiologists to surgeries.  

\- \*\*Job-Shop Scheduling\*\* ‚Äî sequencing operations over time on limited resources (rooms, personnel).  

\- \*\*Bin-Packing with Time Windows\*\* ‚Äî grouping surgeries into shifts of limited duration.



Because both \*\*temporal\*\* and \*\*logical\*\* constraints are involved, the model has a \*\*mixed discrete‚Äìcontinuous\*\* nature and cannot be solved by simple polynomial-time algorithms.

\## 3. Theoretical Classification



| Aspect | Description | Complexity Class |

|---------|--------------|------------------|

| Assignment of surgeries to anesthesiologists | Equivalent to bipartite matching under temporal constraints | NP-hard |

| Room allocation with time overlap restrictions | Equivalent to interval graph coloring | NP-complete |

| Shift duration constraints (5‚Äì12h window) | Adds nonlinear boundary conditions | NP-hard extension |

| Combined model (rooms + anesthesiologists + overtime) | Mixed-Integer Scheduling | Strongly NP-hard |



Therefore, the overall anesthesiologist scheduling task is a \*\*strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem\*\*.

\## 4. Structural Properties

\- The decision space grows \*\*exponentially\*\* with the number of surgeries:  

&nbsp; if there are N surgeries and M potential anesthesiologists, the number of possible assignments is O(M‚Åø).  

\- The presence of time-dependent and cross-resource constraints (buffers, room exclusivity) prevents the use of pure greedy or flow-based polynomial algorithms.  

\- The cost function is \*\*piecewise linear\*\*, but the dependency between variables (duration ‚Üí cost) introduces nonlinear discontinuities, complicating convex relaxation.



---



\## 5. Implications for Solving

\- \*\*Exact optimization\*\* (global optimum) is computationally infeasible for large N.  

\- \*\*Constraint Programming (CP)\*\* and \*\*hybrid SAT/ILP solvers\*\* like OR-Tools CP-SAT provide a tractable compromise: they prune the search space using logical propagation and linear relaxations.  

\- \*\*Heuristic and metaheuristic approaches\*\* (e.g., Large Neighborhood Search, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms) can yield near-optimal results for large datasets where CP-SAT runtime exceeds limits.

\## 6. Complexity of Subproblems

| Subproblem | Relation | Known Algorithm | Complexity |

|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|

| Single-room scheduling | Equivalent to interval scheduling | Polynomial (O(n log n)) |

| Multi-room allocation | Parallel machine scheduling | NP-hard |

| Anesthesiologist grouping | Set partitioning with bounds | NP-hard |

| Overtime minimization | Piecewise linear optimization | NP-hard |

| Global combined model | Multi-resource scheduling | Strongly NP-hard |



This shows that even simplified versions of the task remain NP-hard once time windows and resource exclusivity are introduced.
