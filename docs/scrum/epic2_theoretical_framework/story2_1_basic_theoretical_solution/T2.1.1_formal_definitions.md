\# üß© T2.1.1 ‚Äî Formal Definition of Sets, Mappings, and Variables



\## 1. Purpose

To formally define all mathematical sets, mappings, and decision variables used in the optimization model.  

The goal is to ensure consistency, theoretical rigor, and direct compatibility with the CP-SAT formulation.

\## 2. Sets



\### Surgeries (S)

Each surgery `s ‚àà S` is a fixed event with known time boundaries.

\- Parameters:

&nbsp; - `start\_s` ‚Äî surgery start time  

&nbsp; - `end\_s` ‚Äî surgery end time  

&nbsp; - `duration\_s = end\_s ‚àí start\_s` ‚Äî surgery duration  

Surgeries are fixed in time and cannot be shifted.



\### Anesthesiologists (A)

Each element `a ‚àà A` represents a \*\*single working shift\*\* of an anesthesiologist.  

Even if the same person works multiple days, each shift is treated as a unique entity.  

The solver dynamically determines the minimum number of anesthesiologists required to cover all surgeries.



\### Rooms (R)

`R = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, ROOMS\_MAX}` ‚Äî finite set of available operating rooms.  

At any given moment, a room can host no more than one surgery.



\### Time (T)

Represents a continuous or discretized time axis with step size `TIME\_UNIT` (default = 5 minutes).  

Used for reasoning and validation, but not always explicitly in CP-SAT.

\## 3. Mapping Functions



\- `room(s) ‚Üí R` ‚Äî assigns surgery `s` to a room.  

\- `anesth(s) ‚Üí A` ‚Äî assigns surgery `s` to an anesthesiologist.  

\- `time(s) ‚Üí (start\_s, end\_s)` ‚Äî returns the time interval of surgery `s`.  

\- `shift(a) ‚Üí \[t\_min(a), t\_max(a)]` ‚Äî defines the time span of anesthesiologist `a`‚Äôs shift.  

\- `duration(a) ‚Üí t\_max(a) ‚àí t\_min(a)` ‚Äî computes shift duration.  

\- `cost(a) ‚Üí ‚Ñù‚Å∫` ‚Äî computes total cost of the shift (including overtime).

\## 4. Model Variables



\- \*\*x\[s, a] ‚àà {0, 1}\*\*  

&nbsp; Binary assignment variable:  

&nbsp; `x\[s, a] = 1` if surgery `s` is performed by anesthesiologist `a`, otherwise 0.



\- \*\*y\[s, r] ‚àà {0, 1}\*\*  

&nbsp; Binary assignment variable:  

&nbsp; `y\[s, r] = 1` if surgery `s` is assigned to room `r`, otherwise 0.



\- \*\*t\_min\[a], t\_max\[a] ‚àà ‚Ñù\*\*  

&nbsp; Real-valued variables defining the start and end of anesthesiologist `a`‚Äôs shift.  

&nbsp; Derived from assigned surgeries:

&nbsp; - `t\_min\[a] = min(start\_s : x\[s, a] = 1)`  

&nbsp; - `t\_max\[a] = max(end\_s : x\[s, a] = 1)`



\- \*\*duration\[a] ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫\*\*  

&nbsp; Shift duration:  

&nbsp; `duration\[a] = t\_max\[a] ‚àí t\_min\[a]`



\- \*\*cost\[a] ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫\*\*  

&nbsp; Shift cost:  

&nbsp; `cost\[a] = max(SHIFT\_MIN, duration\[a]) + (OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER ‚àí 1) √ó max(0, duration\[a] ‚àí SHIFT\_OVERTIME)`



\- \*\*active\[a] ‚àà {0,1}\*\*  

&nbsp; Binary indicator: 1 if anesthesiologist `a` is assigned to at least one surgery, 0 otherwise.  

&nbsp; Used in multi-objective formulations to minimize both number of active anesthesiologists and cost.



---



\## 5. Derived Relations and Predicates



\- \*\*Overlap(s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ)\*\*  

&nbsp; True if surgeries overlap in time:  

&nbsp; `Overlap(s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ) = True ‚áî \[start‚ÇÅ, end‚ÇÅ] ‚à© \[start‚ÇÇ, end‚ÇÇ] ‚â† ‚àÖ`



\- \*\*BufferConstraint(a, s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ)\*\*  

&nbsp; If anesthesiologist `a` performs surgeries `s‚ÇÅ` and `s‚ÇÇ` in different rooms:  

&nbsp; `start‚ÇÇ ‚â• end‚ÇÅ + BUFFER`  

&nbsp; (no constraint if both surgeries are in the same room).



\- \*\*ShiftFeasible(a)\*\*  

&nbsp; True if:  

&nbsp; `SHIFT\_MIN ‚â§ duration\[a] ‚â§ SHIFT\_MAX`



---



\## 6. Extensibility Notes

The current structure of sets and variables allows for straightforward future extensions:

\- `S\_day ‚äÜ S` ‚Äî partition surgeries by day for multi-day planning.  

\- Separate human and shift levels: `A\_human` vs `A\_shift`.  

\- Incorporate stochastic start times or variable surgery durations.  

\- Introduce additional mappings for handovers or cross-shift coverage.
