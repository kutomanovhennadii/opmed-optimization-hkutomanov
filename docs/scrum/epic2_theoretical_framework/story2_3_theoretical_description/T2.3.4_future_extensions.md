\# üß© T2.3.4 ‚Äî Outline of Future Model Extensions (Multi-Day, Handover, Stochastic Optimization)



\## 1. Purpose

To outline potential \*\*future extensions\*\* of the anesthesiologist allocation model beyond the single-day deterministic formulation.  

These enhancements target increased realism, scalability, and adaptability to uncertain or evolving operational contexts ‚Äî transforming the model from a static optimization task into a \*\*dynamic scheduling system\*\*.



---



\## 2. Motivation

The current model optimizes a \*\*single-day deterministic schedule\*\* under fixed parameters (surgery times, rooms, and costs).  

However, in real hospital settings:

\- Schedules span multiple days or weeks.  

\- Anesthesiologists work across overlapping shifts.  

\- Surgeries may be delayed, canceled, or extended.  

\- Costs and resource availability vary stochastically.  



Thus, the model must evolve toward \*\*multi-period, multi-objective, and uncertainty-aware optimization\*\*.

\## 3. Extension 1 ‚Äî Multi-Day and Multi-Horizon Scheduling



\### 3.1. Description

Expand the time horizon from one day to several days or weeks, incorporating continuity of staff and room availability.



\### 3.2. Theoretical Adjustments

\- Introduce a \*\*time index d ‚àà D = {1, ‚Ä¶, H}\*\*, representing days or planning periods.  

\- Extend decision variables:

&nbsp; - x\[s,a,d]: assignment of anesthesiologist a to surgery s on day d.  

&nbsp; - y\[s,r,d]: room allocation by day.  

\- Maintain continuity constraints:

&nbsp; - Anesthesiologist may not exceed total weekly hours limit (e.g., 60h).  

&nbsp; - Rest period ‚â• 12h between end of one shift and start of next.  

\- Add periodic cost terms:

&nbsp; - C\_total = Œ£‚Çça,d‚Çé cost\[a,d]  

&nbsp; - Weekly utilization U\_weekly = Œ£(duration\_s,d) / Œ£(cost\[a,d])



\### 3.3. Implications

The model becomes a \*\*multi-period resource-constrained scheduling problem (RCS)\*\*, with periodic boundaries and inter-day coupling.  

Solution methods include decomposition:

\- Per-day CP-SAT subproblems linked by master constraints (Benders or Lagrangian relaxation).  

\- Parallel solving across days with shared cost synchronization.

\## 4. Extension 2 ‚Äî Shift Handover and Continuity Modeling



\### 4.1. Description

Enable splitting long surgeries (>12h) between multiple anesthesiologists via \*\*handover protocols\*\*.



\### 4.2. New Entities

\- \*\*Handover point h ‚àà H\_s\*\* for each surgery s ‚Äî discrete time when responsibility shifts.  

\- \*\*Compatibility variable z\[a‚ÇÅ,a‚ÇÇ,s,h] ‚àà {0,1}\*\* ‚Äî 1 if anesthesiologist a‚ÇÇ continues work of a‚ÇÅ at point h.  



\### 4.3. Additional Constraints

\- Surgery coverage continuity:

&nbsp; - For each surgery s: coverage timeline is contiguous, no time gaps.  

\- Handover buffer:

&nbsp; - end(a‚ÇÅ,s‚ÇÅ) ‚â§ start(a‚ÇÇ,s‚ÇÇ) + HANDOVER\_BUFFER (e.g., 10 min overlap).  

\- Shift linkage:

&nbsp; - duration\[a‚ÇÅ] ‚â§ 12h, duration\[a‚ÇÇ] ‚â§ 12h, combined coverage = duration\_s.  



\### 4.4. Cost and Efficiency

\- Introduce \*\*handover penalty P\_hand = 0.1 √ó duration\_h\*\* to account for efficiency loss.  

\- Revised total cost:

&nbsp; - C\_total = Œ£(cost\[a]) + Œ£(P\_hand √ó z\[a‚ÇÅ,a‚ÇÇ,s,h]).  



This transforms the model into a \*\*multi-agent coverage problem\*\* with continuity constraints ‚Äî solvable using hybrid CP-SAT + network flow formulations.

\## 5. Extension 3 ‚Äî Stochastic and Robust Optimization



\### 5.1. Description

Model uncertainty in surgery duration, start times, and cancellations using \*\*stochastic optimization\*\* or \*\*robust scheduling\*\*.



\### 5.2. Stochastic Variables

\- duration\_s ~ Normal(Œº\_s, œÉ\_s)  

\- start\_s ~ Œº\_s ¬± Œµ  

\- OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER variable with distribution based on policy uncertainty.



\### 5.3. Approaches

1\. \*\*Scenario-based Stochastic Programming:\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Generate N\_scenarios samples of uncertain durations.  

&nbsp;  - Solve expected-cost minimization:

&nbsp;    - Minimize E\[C\_total(scenario)]  

&nbsp;  - Maintain probabilistic feasibility: P(feasible) ‚â• 0.95.



2\. \*\*Robust Optimization:\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Define uncertainty sets (¬±Œî) for durations and buffers.  

&nbsp;  - Ensure feasibility under worst-case within Œî.  

&nbsp;  - Objective: Minimize max\_Œî C\_total(Œî).



3\. \*\*Adaptive Scheduling:\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Two-stage optimization:

&nbsp;    - Stage 1: Pre-assign base schedule.  

&nbsp;    - Stage 2: Re-optimize locally as new information arrives (rolling horizon).



\### 5.4. Theoretical Benefits

\- Reduces expected overtime penalties.  

\- Increases resilience to disruptions.  

\- Produces probabilistically stable schedules.

\## 6. Extension 4 ‚Äî Multi-Objective Formulation



\### 6.1. Motivation

Real hospital operations balance multiple priorities:

\- Cost minimization,  

\- Fairness across staff (workload balance),  

\- Service quality (minimized patient delay),  

\- Robustness under uncertainty.



\### 6.2. Mathematical Model

Define vector-valued objective:

‚ÄÉMinimize F = \[C\_total, Fairness, Robustness, U‚Åª¬π]  

subject to all base constraints.



Aggregate via weighted or lexicographic combination:

‚ÄÉMinimize Œ±‚ÇÅ¬∑C\_total + Œ±‚ÇÇ¬∑Fairness + Œ±‚ÇÉ¬∑Penalty(violations)



This yields a \*\*Pareto frontier\*\* of trade-offs between cost and robustness.



---



\## 7. Extension 5 ‚Äî Data-Driven Learning Integration



Incorporate feedback from real scheduling data:

\- Predict expected surgery durations via regression or Bayesian estimation.  

\- Dynamically tune solver hyperparameters based on historical performance.  

\- Use reinforcement learning to guide CP-SAT branching priorities.  



This forms a \*\*learning-enhanced optimization pipeline (LEO)\*\* ‚Äî where the model continuously adapts to new hospital data.
