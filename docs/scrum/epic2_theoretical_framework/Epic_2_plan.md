# ðŸ§  Epic 2 â€” Theoretical Framework

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this epic is to establish the **theoretical foundation** of the optimization model for anesthesiologist allocation.  
This stage defines the formal mathematical model, identifies the optimization class, analyzes algorithmic approaches, and develops a consistent theoretical justification for all subsequent architectural and implementation steps.

---

## 2. Scope
Epic 2 covers all theoretical, mathematical, and algorithmic work necessary before implementation.  
It bridges the analytical problem definition (Epic 1) and the software architecture design (Epic 3).

Theoretical outputs will include:
- A complete formal model of the optimization task.  
- Comparison of applicable algorithmic methods (CP-SAT, MILP, LNS, metaheuristics).  
- A framework for parameter tuning and performance estimation.  
- The final consolidated document `Theoretical_Model.md`.

## 4. Integration with Project Roadmap
- **Inputs:** Outputs from Epic 1 (`Problem_Formulation.md`, variable definitions, constraints).  
- **Outputs:** Theoretical model and algorithmic recommendations for Epic 3 (architecture).  
- **Dependencies:** None beyond completion of Epic 1.  
- **Downstream impact:** Epic 3 (Solver architecture), Epic 4 (Development planning).

## 5. Expected Artifacts
- Markdown documents for all stories and tasks.  
- Final theoretical report `Theoretical_Model.md`.  
- Diagrams and visual models (where needed).  
- Citations to academic literature (appendix in Story 2.2).  
- Updated glossary of terms and variable definitions.

## 6. Success Criteria
Epic 2 is considered **complete** when:
- The optimization model is fully defined and theoretically validated.  
- The selected algorithm (CP-SAT) is justified with complexity analysis.  
- Parameter tuning framework is described and approved.  
- Theoretical_Model.md is finalized and committed to the repository.
