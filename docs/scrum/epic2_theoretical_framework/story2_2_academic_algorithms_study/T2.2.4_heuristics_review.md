\# üß© T2.2.4 ‚Äî Literature Review of Resource-Constrained Scheduling Heuristics



\## 1. Purpose

To summarize and analyze the most influential academic and engineering sources relevant to \*\*resource-constrained scheduling\*\* and \*\*hybrid combinatorial optimization\*\*, focusing on the theoretical and architectural underpinnings of Google‚Äôs \*\*CP-SAT solver\*\*.  

This review provides context for the hybrid model adopted in the Opmed anesthesiologist allocation project.

\## 2. Overview: Resource-Constrained Scheduling Paradigms

Resource-constrained scheduling (RCS) represents a family of NP-hard problems where tasks (surgeries, in this case) must be assigned to limited resources (anesthesiologists, rooms, time) under temporal and logical constraints.  

Historically, RCS problems were addressed via:

\- \*\*MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming)\*\* ‚Äî good for small linearizable formulations.  

\- \*\*Constraint Programming (CP)\*\* ‚Äî better suited for logical and temporal reasoning.  

\- \*\*Heuristics / Metaheuristics\*\* ‚Äî e.g., Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms, LNS for scalability.  

\- \*\*Hybrid Solvers (CP-SAT, CP-MIP)\*\* ‚Äî combining multiple paradigms for generality and performance.



Google‚Äôs \*\*CP-SAT solver\*\* represents the most advanced implementation of the hybrid approach, merging CP, SAT, and MIP principles into one unified engine.

\## 3. Key Sources and Contributions



\### 3.1. Official Documentation

\*\*Google OR-Tools Documentation (developers.google.com)\*\*  

Describes CP-SAT as an integer-based hybrid solver optimized for discrete scheduling, routing, and assignment tasks.  

It emphasizes that CP-SAT is faster than traditional MIP solvers for many combinatorial problems and integrates specialized interval and linear constraints for scheduling.



---



\### 3.2. ‚ÄúThe CP-SAT Primer‚Äù (Daniel Krupke, 2024)

An accessible yet technically rigorous online article providing an in-depth breakdown of CP-SAT‚Äôs inner workings.  

It explains that CP-SAT operates as a \*\*multi-strategy portfolio solver\*\* built around \*\*Lazy Clause Generation (LCG)\*\* ‚Äî a framework that combines:

\- SAT-solving via \*\*CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning)\*\*,  

\- CP constraint propagation,  

\- and linear relaxation (simplex, cutting planes).  



Krupke presents a clear view of how CP-SAT orchestrates parallel search workers using hybrid reasoning layers, providing a bridge between CP theory and SAT/MIP logic.

\### 3.3. MiniZinc Challenge Solver Descriptions (2017‚Äì2024)

Annual ‚Äúwhite papers‚Äù from Google‚Äôs team describe CP-SAT‚Äôs five-layer architecture:

1\. \*\*SAT Core\*\* ‚Äî a CDCL solver managing Boolean reasoning.  

2\. \*\*Constraint Layer\*\* ‚Äî integer and interval variables with global constraints (e.g., `NoOverlap`).  

3\. \*\*LP Relaxation Layer\*\* ‚Äî simplex-based linear relaxation providing dual bounds.  

4\. \*\*Unified Model Representation\*\* ‚Äî all layers communicate via a shared protobuf model.  

5\. \*\*Portfolio and LNS Layer\*\* ‚Äî parallel search using different strategies, exchanging bounds and solutions.  



These papers highlight CP-SAT‚Äôs hybrid nature, uniting \*\*CP, SAT, MIP, and MaxSAT\*\* into a single consistent algorithmic framework.

\### 3.4. CPAIOR 2020 Masterclass (Laurent Perron, Fr√©d√©ric Didier)

A conference tutorial offering direct insight from the CP-SAT creators.  

Key highlights:

\- The solver runs \*\*multiple parallel workers\*\*, each using a different heuristic or local search strategy (including LNS).  

\- Integration of \*\*LP relaxations\*\* within the SAT search for improved bounding.  

\- \*\*Lazy Clause Generation\*\* as the unifying principle linking constraint propagation with SAT learning.  



The session emphasized CP-SAT‚Äôs ability to handle large-scale real scheduling tasks, combining CP interpretability with SAT‚Äôs robustness and MIP‚Äôs numerical precision.

\### 3.5. ‚ÄúCP-SAT for Scheduling‚Äù (Laurent Perron, 2021)

A dedicated seminar on applying CP-SAT to scheduling problems.  

Key takeaways:

\- CP-SAT is essentially a \*\*‚Äúreboot‚Äù of CP\*\* using a SAT backend.  

\- CDCL allows stronger conflict learning than traditional CP solvers.  

\- Supports \*\*interval-based reasoning\*\* for precise time-based tasks.  

\- Incorporates \*\*LNS (Large Neighborhood Search)\*\* as a top-level metaheuristic.  



Perron acknowledges inspiration from \*\*Peter Stuckey‚Äôs\*\* ‚ÄúSearch is Dead‚Äù (CP 2013) and the \*\*Chuffed\*\* solver, both seminal in the evolution of LCG.



---



\### 3.6. ‚ÄúThe CP-SAT-LP Solver‚Äù (Perron et al., CP 2023)

An invited talk and short paper detailing recent innovations:

\- Integration of \*\*simplex-based LP solving\*\* directly into the SAT core.  

\- Use of \*\*dual reasoning\*\*, \*\*cut generation\*\*, and \*\*reduced cost fixing\*\* within the hybrid search.  

\- Portfolio of heterogeneous search strategies, combining global MIP-style reasoning with local CP propagation.  



The CP-SAT-LP variant now rivals top commercial MILP solvers (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX) on purely integer problems and leads the CP community benchmarks.



---



\### 3.7. ‚ÄúLazy Clause Generation: Combining the Power of SAT and CP (and MIP?)‚Äù (Peter J. Stuckey, CPAIOR 2010)

A foundational work introducing \*\*Lazy Clause Generation\*\*, the core concept behind CP-SAT.  

LCG allows CP solvers to create Boolean explanations for propagation outcomes, which can be reused by a SAT solver to learn from conflicts.  

This mechanism creates synergy between the expressiveness of CP and the search efficiency of SAT, forming the conceptual backbone of CP-SAT.  

The paper also speculates on merging LP relaxations into this architecture ‚Äî an idea later realized in CP-SAT-LP.

|---------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|

| \*\*CP\*\* | Choco, Chuffed | Strong in discrete reasoning | Weak numerical bounds |

| \*\*SAT\*\* | Glucose, MiniSAT | Fast Boolean learning | Lacks numeric interpretation |

| \*\*MIP\*\* | Gurobi, CPLEX | Strong global bounds | Poor at combinatorial logic |

| \*\*LNS\*\* | OR-Tools LNS | Efficient local refinement | No optimality guarantee |

| \*\*Hybrid CP-SAT\*\* | OR-Tools CP-SAT | Combines CP + SAT + LP | Complex tuning and architecture |

\## 5. Applications in Resource-Constrained Scheduling

Empirical studies show CP-SAT outperforming traditional MILP on large-scale scheduling:

\- \*\*Job-shop scheduling\*\* (IBM/Politecnico di Milano studies): CP-SAT achieved faster convergence with tighter bounds.  

\- \*\*Nurse rostering and machine allocation\*\*: CP-SAT consistently produced feasible solutions where MILP failed within time limits.  

\- \*\*Surgery scheduling\*\* (related domain): Hybrid CP-SAT formulations yield better balance between time feasibility and overtime minimization.
