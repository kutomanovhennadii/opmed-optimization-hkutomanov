\# ðŸ§© T2.2.1 â€” Comparative Analysis of CP-SAT, MILP, LNS, and Evolutionary Heuristics



\## 1. Purpose

To perform a theoretical comparison between four major optimization paradigms â€” \*\*CP-SAT\*\*, \*\*MILP\*\*, \*\*LNS\*\*, and \*\*Evolutionary Heuristics\*\* â€” in the context of the anesthesiologist scheduling problem.

The goal is to evaluate their expressive power, computational properties, and suitability for the hybrid temporalâ€“resource constraints defined in Epic 1.

\## 2. Problem Context Recap

The anesthesiologist allocation task involves:

\- Binary assignment variables (`x\[s,a]`, `y\[s,r]`);

\- Interval-based temporal reasoning (start, end, duration, non-overlap);

\- Piecewise-linear cost functions (overtime handling);

\- Logical dependencies (buffers, activation, duration bounds).



Hence, the ideal optimization framework must handle \*\*mixed logical, temporal, and linear constraints\*\* efficiently and reproducibly.

\## 4. Observations



\### 4.1. CP-SAT

\- Combines logical constraint modeling with linear optimization.

\- Excels in structured interval problems with explicit non-overlap constraints.

\- Produces deterministic, optimal solutions for small and medium problem sizes.

\- Can integrate with LNS for hybrid metaheuristic acceleration.



\### 4.2. MILP

\- Strong for purely linear, convex optimization problems.

\- Struggles with non-linearities and discrete temporal constraints (e.g., buffer handling).

\- Requires complex auxiliary binary variables to simulate piecewise functions and time overlaps.

\- Becomes inefficient for problems with many conditional constraints.



\### 4.3. LNS (Large Neighborhood Search)

\- Iteratively destroys and rebuilds parts of an existing feasible solution.

\- Effective in refining results of CP-SAT when optimal search is computationally expensive.

\- Can yield near-optimal results quickly but lacks guarantees.

\- Sensitive to neighborhood size and selection heuristics.



\### 4.4. Evolutionary Heuristics (GA / DE / PSO)

\- Explore solution space via populations and mutation mechanisms.

\- Robust against local minima but require extensive parameter tuning.

\- Often slower to converge and less explainable.

\- Suitable as fallback or hybrid enhancer for very large datasets (N > 10,000 surgeries).

\## 5. Hybridization Opportunities

Practical research suggests combining solvers:

\- \*\*CP-SAT + LNS\*\* â€” CP-SAT provides initial feasible solutions; LNS improves them with localized exploration.

\- \*\*CP-SAT + Evolutionary Search\*\* â€” population-based methods propose initial parameter seeds or schedule partitions.

\- \*\*MILP + CP-SAT\*\* â€” MILP can optimize a relaxed version of the problem (e.g., cost only), feeding results as bounds to CP-SAT.



Such hybrid architectures can deliver significant improvements in runtime and robustness for real hospital-scale scenarios.

| Feature | Best Performing Method |

|----------|------------------------|

| Logical constraints \& conditional rules | CP-SAT |

| Pure linear models | MILP |

| Rapid local optimization | LNS |

| Large-scale approximate exploration | Evolutionary Heuristics |

| Deterministic reproducibility | CP-SAT |

| Hybrid scalability | CP-SAT + LNS |

\## 7. Conclusion

For the Opmed anesthesiologist scheduling problem:

\- \*\*CP-SAT\*\* provides the best overall performance-to-expressiveness ratio.

\- \*\*LNS\*\* serves as a strong hybrid companion for improving runtime on larger datasets.

\- \*\*MILP\*\* is unsuitable without major simplification of the model.

\- \*\*Evolutionary methods\*\* are secondary options for large-scale stochastic optimization experiments.



Thus, the theoretically justified solver strategy is \*\*CP-SAT as the primary engine\*\*, optionally enhanced by \*\*LNS metaheuristics\*\* for near-optimal refinement.
