\# üß© T1.1.7 ‚Äî Validity Criteria for the Solution



\## 1. General Concept

The purpose of validation is to ensure that the generated schedule satisfies all problem constraints and contains no logical conflicts.

A solution is considered \*\*valid\*\* if and only if all the following conditions are met.



\## 2. Validity Criteria



\### 2.1. Surgery Coverage

\- Each surgery must be assigned to \*\*exactly one anesthesiologist\*\* and \*\*exactly one room\*\*.

\- No surgeries may remain unassigned or be assigned to multiple anesthesiologists or rooms.



\### 2.2. Non-overlapping Time Constraints

\- The same anesthesiologist cannot participate in two overlapping surgeries.

\- Only one surgery may occur in a given room at any time.

\- A 15-minute \*\*buffer\*\* must be respected when an anesthesiologist transitions between rooms.

&nbsp; - If two consecutive surgeries occur in the same room ‚Üí no buffer is required.

&nbsp; - If they occur in different rooms ‚Üí `start\_time‚ÇÇ ‚â• end\_time‚ÇÅ + BUFFER`.



\### 2.3. Shift Duration Constraints

\- For every anesthesiologist: `SHIFT\_MIN ‚â§ duration ‚â§ SHIFT\_MAX`.

\- If `ENFORCE\_SURGERY\_DURATION\_LIMIT = true`, surgeries longer than 12 hours are considered invalid.

\- If `false`, such surgeries are allowed but generate a warning message.



\### 2.4. Temporal Consistency

\- All surgeries must fit within the planning horizon (e.g., a single day).

\- Start time must precede end time (`start < end`).

\- No negative durations are allowed.

\- All temporal fields must be valid and convertible to `datetime64`.



\### 2.5. Identifier Consistency

\- All `surgery\_id` values must be unique.

\- All `anesthetist\_id` and `room\_id` values must belong to their defined sets.

\- No missing, null, or undefined values are allowed (no NaN, None, or empty strings).



\### 2.6. Efficiency Requirement

\- The utilization metric

&nbsp; `utilization = Œ£(duration\_surgeries) / Œ£(cost\_anesthesiologists)`

&nbsp; must be at least equal to `UTILIZATION\_TARGET` (as per assignment ‚â• 0.8).

\- If utilization is below this threshold, the schedule is technically valid but considered \*\*inefficient\*\* (conditionally valid).



\### 2.7. Reproducibility

\- To comply with MLOps best practices, the following must be recorded for each solver run:

&nbsp; - `random\_seed` value,

&nbsp; - solver hyperparameters,

&nbsp; - OR-Tools version.

\- Only runs that can be reproduced under identical conditions are considered fully valid.



\## 3. Validation Report Format

Validation results are stored as a JSON file `validation\_report.json` with the following structure:



{

&nbsp; "timestamp": "2025-10-29T10:45:00",

&nbsp; "valid": true,

&nbsp; "errors": \[],

&nbsp; "warnings": \[

&nbsp;   "Surgery case\_127 exceeds 12h but duration limit disabled"

&nbsp; ],

&nbsp; "metrics": {

&nbsp;   "total\_cost": 185.0,

&nbsp;   "utilization": 0.83,

&nbsp;   "num\_anesthetists": 14

&nbsp; }

}
