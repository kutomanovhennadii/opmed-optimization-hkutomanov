ðŸ§© T1.1.6 â€” Input Data Structure and File Format



\## 1. Input Overview

The model receives two primary inputs:

1\. Main data file â€” `surgeries.csv` or `schedule.parquet`, containing all surgeries.

2\. Configuration file â€” `config.yaml`, defining constants, solver parameters, and behavioral flags.



\### surgeries.csv

Each row represents one scheduled surgery.



| Field | Type | Description |

|--------|------|-------------|

| surgery\_id | string / int | Unique identifier of the surgery |

| start\_time | datetime | Surgery start time |

| end\_time | datetime | Surgery end time |

| duration | float (hours) | Computed as end\_time - start\_time |

| room\_hint | string (optional) | Predefined or preferred operating room |

| priority | int (optional) | Surgery priority for future heuristics |

| day | date (optional) | Used for multi-day planning extensions |



Required fields: surgery\_id, start\_time, end\_time.

The duration field may be computed automatically during loading.



\### config.yaml

Defines model parameters, constants, and solver behavior:



ROOMS\_MAX: 20

SHIFT\_MIN: 5

SHIFT\_MAX: 12

SHIFT\_OVERTIME: 9

OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER: 1.5

BUFFER: 0.25  (15 minutes in hours)

UTILIZATION\_TARGET: 0.8

TIME\_UNIT: 0.0833  (default 5 min; adjustable)

ENFORCE\_SURGERY\_DURATION\_LIMIT: true  (if false, long surgeries allowed)



solver:

&nbsp; max\_time\_in\_seconds: 300

&nbsp; num\_search\_workers: 8

&nbsp; search\_branching: AUTOMATIC

&nbsp; random\_seed: 42



\## 2. Data Requirements

1\. All surgeries must fall within a single day (for the current assignment). Multi-day extension is allowed later.

2\. start\_time < end\_time must always hold.

3\. All timestamps are expressed in a unified timezone (local or UTC).

4\. Duplicate surgery\_id values are not allowed.

5\. All time fields must be convertible to pandas datetime64.



\## 3. In-Memory Representation

After loading, the dataset is converted into a pandas DataFrame:



| Column 		| Type 		| Example 				|

|---------	|------		|---------				|

| surgery\_id 	| str 			| case\_101 				|

| start\_time 	| datetime64 	| 2023-04-25 07:00:00 	|

| end\_time 	| datetime64 	| 2023-04-25 08:30:00 	|

| duration 	| float 		| 1.5 						|

| room\_id 		| str		 	| room-7 					|



Additional derived fields may be computed, such as:

start\_offset = (start\_time - day\_start).total\_seconds() / 3600,

to convert absolute timestamps into continuous time coordinates.



\## 4. Output Format (for reference)

The solver produces solution.csv with the following structure:



| Column 				| Type 		| Description 					|

|---------			|------		|-------------					|

| surgery\_id 			| str 			| Surgery identifier 			|

| start\_time 			| datetime 	| Surgery start time 			|

| end\_time 			| datetime 	| Surgery end time 				|

| anesthetist\_id 	| str 			| Assigned anesthesiologist 	|

| room\_id 			| str 		  	| Assigned operating room 		|



\## 5. Notes

\- The TIME\_UNIT parameter defines the internal discretization step and can be tuned depending on the solver configuration.

\- The ENFORCE\_SURGERY\_DURATION\_LIMIT flag allows toggling the artificial 12-hour restriction to maintain compatibility with the task while keeping the architecture extensible for real-world scenarios (handover between anesthesiologists, multi-day operations, etc.).
