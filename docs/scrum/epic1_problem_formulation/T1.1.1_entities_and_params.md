\# üß© T1.1.1 ‚Äî Definition of Key Entities and Parameters



This section defines the fundamental objects of the optimization model ‚Äî surgeries, anesthesiologists, operating rooms, and time intervals ‚Äî along with all fixed parameters (durations, buffers, shift limits, and cost structure).



---



\## 1. Model Entities



\### Surgeries  

Each surgery is a fixed event with known start and end times.  

Surgeries \*\*cannot be shifted in time\*\*.  



Notation:  

`S = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, N}`  



For every surgery \*s ‚àà S\*:  

\- \*\*start\_s\*\* ‚Äî surgery start time  

\- \*\*end\_s\*\* ‚Äî surgery end time  

\- \*\*duration\_s = end\_s ‚àí start\_s\*\* ‚Äî total duration  



---



\### Anesthesiologists  

The number of anesthesiologists is \*\*unlimited\*\*.  

Each anesthesiologist handles one or several surgeries sequentially, following all timing and logistical constraints.  



Each \*\*shift\*\* is modeled as a unique entity, even if it represents the same person returning later.  

Thus, the set of anesthesiologists is actually the set of shifts:  

`A = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, M}` where \*M\* is determined automatically as the minimum required to cover all surgeries.



For every \*a ‚àà A\*:  

\- \*\*t\_min(a)\*\* ‚Äî start time of the first surgery in the shift  

\- \*\*t\_max(a)\*\* ‚Äî end time of the last surgery in the shift  

\- \*\*duration\_a = t\_max(a) ‚àí t\_min(a)\*\* ‚Äî total shift duration  

\- \*\*cost(a)\*\* ‚Äî payment for the shift (see formula below)



---



\### Operating Rooms  

A fixed pool of operating rooms is available:  

`R = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, 20}`  



Each surgery must take place in exactly \*\*one room\*\*,  

and at any given moment only \*\*one surgery\*\* may occupy a room.



---



\### Time  

Time is treated as \*\*continuous\*\* (in hours).  

Discretization (e.g., 5-minute steps) will be introduced later during algorithm design in Epic 2.  



Define a constant for clarity:  

`TIME\_UNIT = 1/12 hour (5 minutes)` ‚Äî base discretization step for later use.

\## 2. Parameters and Constants



| Parameter 		  | Description 						|

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

| \*\*ROOMS\_MAX\*\* 	  | 20 ‚Äî number of operating rooms 				|

| \*\*SHIFT\_MIN\*\* 	  | 5 hours ‚Äî minimum paid shift length 			|

| \*\*SHIFT\_MAX\*\*           | 12 hours ‚Äî maximum allowed shift length 			|

| \*\*SHIFT\_OVERTIME\*\*      | 9 hours ‚Äî overtime threshold 				|

| \*\*OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER\*\* | 1.5√ó ‚Äî pay rate for overtime 				|

| \*\*BUFFER\*\* 		  | Transition time between rooms. If anesthesiologist \*a\* 	|

|			  |performs surgeries \*s‚ÇÅ\* and \*s‚ÇÇ\*, and `room(s‚ÇÅ) ‚â† room(s‚ÇÇ)`,	|

|			  |then `start\_time(s‚ÇÇ) ‚â• end\_time(s‚ÇÅ) + BUFFER`. No buffer is 	|

|			  |required when both surgeries occur in the same room. 	|

| \*\*COST(a)\*\* 		  | `max(5, duration\_a) + 0.5 √ó max(0, duration\_a ‚àí 9)` 	|

| \*\*UTILIZATION\*\* 	  | `Œ£(duration\_surgeries) / Œ£(cost(anesthesiologists))` 	|

| \*\*UTILIZATION\_TARGET\*\*  | 0.8 (80%) ‚Äî target efficiency level 			|

| \*\*TIME\_UNIT\*\* 	  | 1/12 hour (5 minutes) ‚Äî discretization step 		|

\## 3. Key Assumptions



\- Surgeries have fixed start and end times ‚Äî neither is subject to optimization.  

\- Anesthesiologists are \*\*single-use entities\*\*; each new shift, even for the same person, is modeled as a new agent in \*A\*.  

\- The pool of anesthesiologists is unlimited, but the model seeks to \*\*minimize both their total count and total cost\*\*.  

\- The \*\*buffer applies only\*\* when switching between different rooms; consecutive surgeries in the same room require no transition time.  

\- \*\*Shift cost\*\* depends solely on its duration, not on the number of surgeries performed.
