\# ðŸ§© T1.1.3 â€” Objective Function Formulation



The goal of the optimization model is to minimize the total anesthesiologist cost while ensuring that all surgeries and operating rooms are properly assigned and all constraints are met. Formally, we minimize the total cost of all shifts:



C\_total = Î£ cost(a)  for all a âˆˆ A  

where  

duration\_a = t\_max(a) âˆ’ t\_min(a),  

cost(a) = max(SHIFT\_MIN, duration\_a) + (OVERTIME\_MULTIPLIER âˆ’ 1) Ã— max(0, duration\_a âˆ’ SHIFT\_OVERTIME).



This objective ensures that the schedule achieves full coverage with the least possible labor cost while adhering to the limits of working time and operating room capacity.



To evaluate solution efficiency, we introduce an auxiliary metric â€” utilization, defined as:  

U = (Î£ duration\_surgeries) / (Î£ cost(anesthesiologists)),  

where the numerator is the total duration of all surgeries, and the denominator is the total paid working time of all anesthesiologists, including idle time and rounding to the minimum shift length.  

According to Opmedâ€™s guideline, a schedule is considered satisfactory if U â‰¥ 0.8 (80%). This metric is not part of the optimization function but helps to compare solutions with similar costs and different internal efficiency.



In some implementations, the objective can be expanded to a two-level formulation that simultaneously minimizes the number of active anesthesiologists and total cost. Let active\[a] be a binary variable equal to 1 if anesthesiologist a performs at least one surgery. Then the objective can be written as:  

Total\_Objective = Î± Ã— Î£ active\[a] + Î² Ã— Î£ cost(a),  

where Î± and Î² are weighting coefficients (usually Î± >> Î², giving priority to minimizing the number of anesthesiologists over the total duration cost).



In OR-Tools (CP-SAT), this can be expressed as:  

\# single-level  

model.Minimize(sum(cost\[a] for a in anesthesiologists))  

\# two-level  

model.Minimize(alpha \* sum(active\[a] for a in anesthesiologists) + beta \* sum(cost\[a] for a in anesthesiologists))



Minimizing the total cost naturally leads to minimizing the number of active anesthesiologists and maximizing the density of surgeries within each shift. The algorithm seeks to group surgeries efficiently, reducing idle periods and overtime while respecting all temporal and room constraints.
